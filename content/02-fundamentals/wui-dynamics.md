## Overview

About one-third of the housing units and more than 60,000 communities in the United States are currently at risk from WUI fires, which destroy thousands of structures and claim dozens of lives each year, with annual costs estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars .

The wildland-urban interface (WUI) presents unique fire dynamics challenges that differ significantly from both wildland and urban fires. Understanding structure ignition mechanisms and parcel-scale fire spread is essential for effective mitigation and risk assessment.

## Defining the WUI Problem

### Scale and Scope

Since 2000, in the U.S. over 3,000 homes per year are lost to WUI fires, compared to about 900 homes in the 1990s, and 400 homes in the 1970s . In 2011, in Texas alone, over 2,000 homes were destroyed during WUI fires .

### Geographic Distribution

In the U.S, the problem is most acute in the western and southern states; however, WUI fires have also recently destroyed homes in the Mid-Atlantic States and the Pacific Northwest . The WUI fire challenge is truly national in scope and growing in severity.

## Parcel-Scale Fire Spread

Fire behavior at the WUI scale is governed by the interaction of vegetation, structures, and local environmental conditions at distances of meters to hundreds of meters.

### Key Factors

Fire and ember exposure can be traced to four primary sources: wildland fuels, ornamental vegetation and burning of structures (including homes, auxiliary buildings such as sheds and garages) and vehicles .

**Parcel fuels**:
- Ornamental vegetation (often highly flammable non-native species)
- Landscape mulch, wood decks, and stored materials
- Vertical fuel continuity from ground to structures
- Defensible space characteristics (or lack thereof)

**Local topography**:
- Slope immediately around structures
- Aspect relative to prevailing fire-weather winds
- Topographic position (ridgetop, mid-slope, drainage)
- Terrain-induced wind channeling at building scale

**Micro-weather**:
- Building-scale wind patterns and eddies
- Heat reflection and re-radiation from structures
- Local humidity gradients near vegetation

### Structure-to-Structure Fire Spread

Once a structure has ignited, it can contribute substantially to the fire's spread . In dense WUI communities, structure-to-structure fire spread can dominate, independent of wildland fuel involvement.

## Structure Ignition Pathways

Post-fire data collection and analysis reveal how WUI fire behavior is driven by the interactions among fuel, weather, and terrain, and the roles played by heat, embers, and direct flame impingement .

### 1. Ember/Firebrand Ignition

Firebrands, also called embers, are small pieces of burning material emitted by flaming trees and wooden structures and are a major but previously overlooked factor in WUI fire spread .

**Firebrand dynamics**:
Firebrand processes include generation, transport, deposition, and ignition of various fuel types, leading to fire spread processes at distances far removed from the main fire .

**Transport and spotting**:
When carried aloft on wind currents, firebrands can descend and create new fires several kilometers ahead of the main fire .

**Primary ignition mechanism**:
Ember ignition is the most common cause of structure loss in WUI fires, particularly through:
- Accumulation in roof-wall junctions
- Penetration through attic vents
- Ignition of deck materials and attached combustibles
- Landing in leaf litter or mulch adjacent to foundations

### 2. Thermal Radiation

Radiation from the flames travels through space (like the Sun heating the earth) and can ignite structures up to 100 meters (300 feet) away .

**Radiant heat flux zones**:
Zone 3 window breakage of unhardened glass and ignition of exterior combustibles will occur with heat flux levels expected in the range of 0.8 to 2 W/cm² .

**Critical distances**:
- 6-30 m: Significant radiant heating from flaming vegetation
- <6 m: Extreme radiant exposure, near-certain ignition of combustibles
- Building separation requirements based on radiant flux calculations

### 3. Flame Contact

Zone F4 is defined as the area where there is severe heat flux and prolonged direct flame contact, with heat flux level expected to be greater than 2 W/cm² .

**Direct impingement scenarios**:
- Vegetation flames contacting siding, decks, or eaves
- Burning fences or landscaping features against structures
- Fire spreading through attached structures (porches, carports)

### 4. Convective Heating

Hot air from the flames helps spread the fire by convection (like you experience when you sit in front of an air vent in winter) .

Convective heating can:
- Pre-heat building materials ahead of flame arrival
- Draw fire into attic spaces through soffit vents
- Create interior heating in structures with broken windows

## NIST WUI Hazard Scale and FTLW Framework

### The FTLW Approach

The WUI-scale is designed considering combined parameters referred to as FTLW, short for fuels, topography, and local weather .

**F - Fuels**: 
- Wildland vegetation type, density, and proximity
- Ornamental landscaping characteristics
- Structural fuels (auxiliary buildings, vehicles, fencing)

**T - Topography**:
- Slope steepness and aspect
- Terrain position and exposure
- Local wind channeling features

**L - Local conditions**:
- Building materials and design
- Defensible space implementation
- Parcel-level fuel management

**W - Weather**:
- Wind exposure and prevailing patterns
- Extreme fire weather frequency
- Climate-driven fuel moisture regimes

### Exposure Rating System

In the proposed framework, an exposure rating is uncoupled from ignition, and the exposure rating is independent of the response of a particular structural element or landscaping attribute .

This separation allows:
- Objective assessment of fire/ember exposure potential
- Performance-based mitigation strategies
- Community-wide hazard mapping independent of current building stock

## NIST Hazard Mitigation Methodology (HMM)

### Development and Objectives

NIST, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), and the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) developed the Hazard Mitigation Methodology (HMM), a science-based approach built on data from post-fire observations, field analysis and lab research .

### Key Components

NIST, in collaboration with CAL FIRE and IBHS, has compiled a detailed list of mitigation actions to protect structures and parcels from ember and flame exposures in WUI fires, with the methodology considering spatial relationships with parcel and neighboring parcel hazards to mitigate structure-to-structure fire spread .

**Ember mitigation**:
All structures must be protected from ember ignitions – the methodology presents 40 identified ember mitigation needs .

**Community-scale considerations**:
The HMM considers factors like building separation and parcel layouts, showing how both community and structural fire protection are essential .

### Implementation and Adoption

CAL FIRE is using the HMM to retrofit six California communities, paving the way for future state and national codes . The United States Fire Administration (USFA) and NIST are working to make HMM part of the national strategy to manage wildland fires, and the International Code Council is also planning to include HMM principles in the 2027 edition of the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code .

## Physics-Based CFD Modeling

### Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and WFDS

A significant gap exists in capabilities for supporting risk assessment and engineering design around fire safety in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), particularly in the context of numerical modeling tools .

**Model development approach**:
NIST is leveraging world-leading fire modeling expertise within the Fire Research Division, particularly in collaboration with the development team of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), in a cooperative and iterative effort leading to the generation of unique model benchmarking and development data .

### USFS-NIST Collaboration

NIST and the U.S. Forest Service are working to extend the capabilities of NIST's Fire Dynamics Simulator to include fire in vegetation as modeled by the U.S. Forest Service's wildland-urban interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) .

**Planned applications**:
Once this effort is complete, NIST is planning to use the Fire Dynamics Simulator to support development of new standards and building codes to reduce structure ignition risk .

### Experimental Validation

NIST is conducting experiments on both burning dynamics of individual specimens and on flame spread in fuel beds, capturing not only global combustion properties but providing measurements of exposure conditions, such as heat fluxes, which are relevant to WUI fire scenarios .

**Wind-driven scenarios**:
Tests are conducted in both quiescent and wind-driven conditions, recognizing the significant role that wind plays in exacerbating the consequences of WUI fire spread .

## Building Codes and Standards

### Current State

Although over 46 million residential structures in the United States are in areas of risk of wildfires, building and fire codes and standards do not provide the same resiliency for structures in wildland-urban interface (WUI) communities as provided in urban communities .

### Paradigm Shift Required

WUI building codes and standards need to shift the research emphasis to hardening the community through less ignition-prone materials, more fire resistant designs, and new technologies to prevent fire spread within communities with less emphasis on wildland fuels management and suppression .

### Research Foundation

Projects within the Fire Risk Reduction in Communities Program seek (through laboratory experiments, field measurements, and computer modeling) to improve our understanding of WUI fire dynamics and structure ignition mechanisms to support standard test methods for building materials and assemblies, guidelines for structural design and residential landscaping, and guidelines for community planning .

## Life Safety and Evacuation

### No-Notice Events

Lessons learned about life safety considerations for no-notice WUI fire events when there is not enough time to evacuate led directly into guidance and recommendations for a paradigm shift and advance evacuation planning and community preparedness .

### ESCAPE Framework

The purpose of ESCAPE (Evacuation and Sheltering Considerations - Assessment, Planning, and Execution) is to use the lessons learned from the NIST Camp Fire case study to present a methodology and other considerations about WUI fire incidents that can be used by small and intermediate-sized WUI communities to help develop notification and evacuation plans .

## Post-Fire Analysis and Learning

### Detailed Case Studies

Detailed study of the Camp Fire identified the influence of widespread spot fire ignitions, community fire spread pathways, burnovers, temporary refuge areas, and rescues on fire spread and life safety during the catastrophic fire .

### Experimental Insights

Dozens of experiments burning combustible fences and woodpiles quantified the hazard of these common parcel-level fuels, which increase local exposure of fire and embers and facilitate fire spread through WUI communities .

## Implications for Modeling and Risk Assessment

### Multi-Scale Challenge

WUI fire modeling requires coupling:
- Landscape wildfire spread (kilometer scale)
- Parcel-level fuel and structure arrangement (10-100 m scale)
- Building component response (centimeter to meter scale)
- Ember transport and ignition (millimeter to kilometer scale)

### Data Requirements

Effective WUI risk assessment demands:
- High-resolution structure and vegetation mapping
- Building material and design characteristics
- Parcel-level fuel treatment status
- Community-scale exposure zones

### Validation Needs

Proven, scientifically based retrofitting strategies are required for homes located in areas prone to WUI fires, and current codes and standards, often developed based on anecdotal information, require validation through research .
