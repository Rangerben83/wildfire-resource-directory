## Overview

Understanding wildfire behavior requires knowledge of fundamental physics, the fire behavior triangle (fuels, weather, topography), and how fires spread across different scales.

## Key Concepts

::: {.callout-note}
## The Fire Behavior Triangle
The three essential factors that determine fire behavior:

1. **Fuels** - The primary controllable factor
2. **Weather** - The dynamic driver of intensity
3. **Topography** - The multiplier on wind and fuels
:::

Understanding these fundamentals is essential for interpreting model outputs and applying them effectively in planning and operations.
