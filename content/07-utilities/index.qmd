title: "Part VII: Utilities & Critical Infrastructure"
---

## Overview

Wildfire poses direct and cascading risks to critical infrastructure systems. This section covers modeling approaches for electric utilities, water systems, and multi-utility coordination.

## Electric Utilities

Electric utilities face ignition risk from their own infrastructure and operational disruption from wildfires. Key applications:

- [Ignition Risk Mapping](electric/ignition-risk.qmd)
- [Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS)](electric/psps.qmd)
- [Wildfire Digital Twins for Utilities](electric/digital-twins.qmd)
- Asset hardening and mitigation planning

## Water & Wastewater Utilities

Water systems face both direct fire impacts and long-term watershed degradation:

- [Direct Infrastructure Impacts](water/impacts.qmd)
- [Watershed & Water Quality](water/watershed.qmd)
- Firefighting demand and system continuity

## Cross-Utility Coordination

- [Multi-Hazard Impacts](coordination.qmd)
- Shared scenario platforms
- Infrastructure resilience standards

## Cascading Failures
Wildfire → PSPS → Water system outage → Emergency services disruption

Integrated modeling across utilities enables coordinated response planning.
